![Summary](https://github.com/Streamline-Essentials/StreamlineWiki/blob/main/website/images/Summary.png?raw=true)
# BukkitOfUtils (BOU for short)
_Easily develop plugins that support both Bukkit and Folia!_

# What is it?
BOU is both a plugin and API. It is designed to ease the development process of making Bukkit plugins that also include support for Folia.

![Why This?](https://github.com/Streamline-Essentials/StreamlineWiki/blob/main/website/images/WhyThis.png?raw=true)
BOU is one of the only plugin-building-frameworks out there that supports both Bukkit (Spigot and Paper - and forks) **_and_** Folia! Plus, its easy-to-understand classes and framework help beginners start developing plugins that they too can understand!

The plugin is also optimized with its own async methods so that the end server owners don't have to worry about lag.

All this coupled with the fact that it has a built-in database framework that uses HikariCP (the fastest database framework at the moment), means that developers don't have to sweat when it comes to making their plugins database-supported.

# What does this base plugin do right now?
As stated before, it's main purpose is to provide a central framework for plugins that use it so you don't have 20 plugins with this framework embedded into it in your plugins folder.

On top of that, it also has a few abilities it does by itself:
- Entity collection.
  - Shows the number of currently loaded mobs in your world.
- Allow server admins to change how many milliseconds there are in between the async ticks the plugin has.
  - This is used for increasing or decreasing the tickrate of the plugin's runnable tasks.
- More will be added later.

# Commands
`/entity-count`
- Get the amount of entities currently loaded on your server.

# How do I get started using this?
Head on over to the plugin's wiki to see how you can use it in your own plugin's project.
